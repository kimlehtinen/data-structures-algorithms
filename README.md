# Data Structures & Algorithms

I'm learning C/C++ by practicing data structures and algorithms.
Writing in quite C-style C++ just for educational purposes, not meant to be latest and greatest C++.

## Run tests
Tests are written using [GoogleTest](https://github.com/google/googletest). The following script will both build the project and run the tests.
```
./run_tests.sh
```
